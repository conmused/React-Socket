#React-Socket (Mixin)
A React Socket mixin for components that handle lifecycles, and custom
connection/disconnection. Good for live events, or managing websockets through state.

This mixin presumes you have browserified both [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) and [socket.io-client](https://github.com/Automattic/socket.io-client).

###Todo:
- Document Methods in the Readme, as socket.io connections/reconnections can be tricky.
- Provide an example of use, both client side and server side.
